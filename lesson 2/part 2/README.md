# Power BI Project: Sales Target vs Actual Sales Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project showcases the complete professional workflow in Power BI:
- **Data Cleaning**
- **Data Modeling**
- **Building a clean, meaningful dashboard**
  
The main goal was to compare **Actual Sales 💰 vs Sales Targets 🎯** across different product **Categories** while maintaining a clean and scalable data model.

- **Order Details**: Transaction-level sales data (Amount, Profit, Quantity, Category, Sub-Category).

## 🛠 What We Did

### 🔹 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed blank values in key columns (Order ID).
- Filtered out incomplete or unnecessary records.
- Ensured consistency in category names.

### 🔹 2. Data Modeling
- Built a **Category Master** table manually to normalize categories.
- Created a **Star Schema**:
  - **Category Master** (Dimension table) linked to **Order Details** and **Sales Target** (Fact tables).
- Established clean **One-to-Many (1:*)** relationships.
- Removed messy Many-to-Many connections.

### 🔹 3. Visualization
- Designed a **professional and clean dashboard**:
  - **Donut Chart**: Profit Contribution by Category.
  - **Clustered Column Chart**: Actual Sales vs Target by Category.
  - **Sales Progress Card**: Displays achievement vs goal.
  - **Detailed Table**: Sales and Target data per Order.
  - **City Analysis** (optional section).

- Focused on **storytelling visuals** with:
  - Proper Titles
  - Clean Layout
  - Business-friendly colors
  - Data Labels for better readability
