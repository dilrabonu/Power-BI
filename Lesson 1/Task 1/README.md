✅ Task 2: Explore the Power BI Interface and Describe Key Sections
Answer:

Power BI has three main views to work with your data:

Report View (Canvas View)

This is the default view where you build your visualizations.

You can drag and drop charts, tables, slicers, and more onto the canvas.

It supports multiple pages like a PowerPoint slide deck for dashboards.

Data View

Shows the actual data in tabular format.

You can see all columns and rows from the loaded dataset.

Useful for checking data quality, values, and creating calculated columns or measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).

Model View

Displays relationships between tables in your dataset.

You can create or modify relationships using drag-and-drop connections.

Important for managing how different tables interact in visuals and calculations.
