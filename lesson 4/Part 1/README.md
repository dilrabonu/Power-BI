# üìä Power BI Sales Dashboard with Advanced DAX Time Intelligence & Cleaning

This Power BI project demonstrates a complete end-to-end sales analysis using **advanced DAX time intelligence functions** and **Power Query-based data cleaning**. It showcases best practices for modeling, transforming, and visualizing sales data professionally.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze shopping trends and sales performance using real-world customer shopping data. It covers everything from data import and cleaning to implementing DAX measures with **time-based filtering**, **text transformation**, and **conditional logic**.

---

## üìÇ Key Components

### üì• Data Import & Cleaning
- Imported raw dataset: `customer_shopping_data`
- Cleaned column names, removed nulls, and corrected data types
- Standardized date format for `invoice_date`
- Created a **custom Date Table** using DAX to enable advanced time intelligence

### üìÖ Date Table (Calendar Dimension)
```dax
DateTable = 
ADDCOLUMNS (
    CALENDAR (
        MIN (customer_shopping_data[invoice_date]),
        MAX (customer_shopping_data[invoice_date])
    ),
    "Year", YEAR([Date]),
    "Month", FORMAT([Date], "MMMM"),
    "MonthNumber", MONTH([Date]),
    "Quarter", "Q" & FORMAT([Date], "Q")
)
 Advanced DAX Themes & Functions Used
üîÅ Time Intelligence
Function	Purpose
DATESBETWEEN	Filter sales between two fixed dates
DATESINPERIOD	Analyze last N days/months/years relative to max date
NEXTDAY, NEXTMONTH, NEXTYEAR	Shift date range forward
PREVIOUSMONTH, PREVIOUSYEAR	Compare with previous periods
LASTDATE, FIRSTDATE	Retrieve boundary dates for filters or calculations

‚ûó Percentage & Division

Sales Percentage = 
DIVIDE([Sales Amount], [Total Sales])
üî§ Text Transformation
Function	Example
UPPER, LOWER	Standardize case
REPLACE, CONCATENATE	Clean & combine strings


CustomerInfo = CONCATENATE(customer_shopping_data[gender], "-", customer_shopping_data[payment_method])
üîé Filtering & Context
Function	Use Case
ALL, ALLEXCEPT	Remove filters for % of total calculations


Sales % of Total = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM(customer_shopping_data[price]),
    CALCULATE(SUM(customer_shopping_data[price]), ALL(DateTable))
)
üß† Conditional Logic
Function	Example
IF, SWITCH	Create dynamic categories or decisions


Category Type = 
SWITCH(TRUE(),
    customer_shopping_data[category] = "Clothing", "Apparel",
    customer_shopping_data[category] = "Technology", "Electronics",
    "Other"
)
