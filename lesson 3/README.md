 Power BI Sales Dashboard â€“ DAX Mastery & Visualization

ðŸ§  What I Learned Today
Todayâ€™s Power BI session focused on mastering DAX functions, data modeling, and dashboard building. I worked hands-on with the Superstore dataset to explore the full lifecycle of building a functional and insightful BI dashboard.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Used
Source: Kaggle Superstore Sales Dataset
File: powerbi-demo.xlsx
Key Columns:

Order Date, Ship Date

Sales, Profit, Quantity, Discount

Product Name, Category, Sub-Category

Region, City, State, Segment

âœ… Key Concepts Covered
ðŸ§± 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
Converted date columns (Order Date, Ship Date) using "Using Locale" method to fix format errors

Corrected data types:

Sales, Profit â†’ Decimal Number

Quantity â†’ Whole Number

Postal Code â†’ Text

All categorical dimensions â†’ Text

ðŸ§® 2. Basic DAX Measures
Created reusable explicit measures:

dax
Copy
Edit
Total Sales     = SUM(train[Sales])
Total Profit    = SUM(train[Profit])
Total Quantity  = SUM(train[Quantity])
Average Discount = AVERAGE(train[Discount])
Displayed using Card visuals for instant KPIs.

ðŸ“† 3. Date & Time Calculated Columns
Created new columns to support dynamic time-based filtering:

dax
Copy
Edit
Order Year      = YEAR(train[Order Date])
Order Month     = FORMAT(train[Order Date], "MMMM")
Order Quarter   = "Q" & FORMAT(train[Order Date], "Q")
Order Weekday   = FORMAT(train[Order Date], "dddd")
ðŸ§  4. Advanced DAX Techniques
ðŸ”¸ CALCULATE() â€“ Filter context manipulation
dax
Copy
Edit
Furniture Profit = CALCULATE(SUM(train[Profit]), train[Category] = "Furniture")
Sales West = CALCULATE(SUM(train[Sales]), train[Region] = "West")
ðŸ”¸ FILTER() â€“ Custom row-level filtering
dax
Copy
Edit
High Discount Sales = CALCULATE(SUM(train[Sales]), FILTER(train, train[Discount] > 0.2))
ðŸ”¸ CONCATENATE() & CONCATENATEX() â€“ Text operations
dax
Copy
Edit
Location = CONCATENATE(train[City], ", " & train[State])
Product List = CONCATENATEX(VALUES(train[Product Name]), train[Product Name], ", ")
ðŸŽ¨ Visualizations Built
KPI Cards: Total Sales, Profit, Quantity, Avg Discount

Bar Chart: Sales by Category

Line Chart: Monthly Sales Trend

Table: Product List per Category

Slicers: Year, Month, Region, Segment

ðŸ“Œ Skills Demonstrated
Data profiling and transformation in Power Query

Explicit vs Implicit measures

Reusable DAX patterns (SUM, CALCULATE, FILTER, FORMAT)

Dimension modeling for time-based analysis

Visual storytelling with KPI metrics & filters
